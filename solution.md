# AtlasCo Telemetry Platform Solution

## Problem
Store telemetry data from millions of IoT devices where each device can have thousands of different attributes (temperature, status, firmware version, etc.) that change over time.

## Solution Overview

### Part A: Database Design
**Challenge**: Store 200 million devices with 10,000 different attributes efficiently.

**Solution**: Use PostgreSQL with a smart table structure:
- **Main tables**: `entities` , `attributes` , `entity_attributes` 
- **Smart partitioning**: Split data by customer and by time 
- **Efficient storage**: Store numbers as numbers, text as text 
- **Fast queries**: Pre-calculate frequently used combinations

**Result**: Can handle 10,000 inserts per second with fast lookups.

### Part B: Real-time Analytics
**Challenge**: Users need immediate results for alerts, but also want to run big analytical reports.

**Solution**: Two-database approach:
- **PostgreSQL**: For real-time operations   
- **Redshift**: For analytics 
- **Kafka pipeline**: Copies data from PostgreSQL to Redshift automatically
- **Smart routing**: Send different types of queries to the right database

**Freshness levels**:
- Critical alerts: Instant (0ms delay)
- Dashboards: Nearly instant (100ms delay)
- Reports: 30 seconds delay
- Big analytics: 5-15 minutes delay

### Part C: Cloud Infrastructure
**Challenge**: Deploy everything securely and scale from development to production.

**Solution**: AWS infrastructure with Terraform:
- **PostgreSQL database**: Automatically configured for high performance
- **Redshift cluster**: Set up for analytics workloads
- **Secure networking**: Private subnets, encrypted connections
- **Environment scaling**: Small setup for dev, large for production

## Key Benefits

1. **Scalable**: Handles 200M devices, can grow to billions
2. **Fast**: Sub-second queries for operational needs
3. **Flexible**: Easy to add new device types and attributes
4. **Reliable**: Automatic backups, monitoring, failover
5. **Secure**: Encrypted data, private networks, access controls

## Trade-offs

- **Single writer limit**: One PostgreSQL server limits write speed 
- **Complex queries**: Some analytics might be slow 
- **Storage costs**: Keeping all historical data can be expensive 

## What's Included

- Complete database schema with example queries
- Full AWS infrastructure code
- Environment configs for dev and production
- Production readiness checklist

## Quick Start

1. `terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"` - Deploy infrastructure (5 minutes)
2. `psql -f schema.sql` - Set up database (2 minutes)  
3. Run example queries to test performance

**Expected performance**: 10,000+ device updates per second, sub-100ms dashboard queries.
